# How to Contribute

Howdy! Thank you for considering contributing to Numu Tracker for iOS. I appreciate your enthusiasm and it means a lot to me.

I'm actively developing Numu Tracker, and I'd hate for you to perform any work that I'm already planning on working on. Please open up an Issue or email me at info@numutracker.com about your plans before doing anything!
